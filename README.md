## Eaglercraft-Server-Paper

This is not ready yet as I've not added my optimizations, please ignore for now!

Universal Eaglercraft server (1.5, 1.8, 1.12) using Paper 1.12.2

Use the `run.bat` file to run on Windows, or `run.sh` to run on macOS or Linux. The server uses port 25565 for both Vanilla and Eaglercraft players.

Based on EaglercraftXServer, EaglercraftXRewind, ViaVersion, SkinsRestorer, and AuthMeReloaded.

You can also download the EaglerMOTD plugin to animate your server's MOTD, and the EaglerWeb plugin to host a website from your server, both of which are available here [https://github.com/lax1dude/eaglerxserver/releases](https://github.com/lax1dude/eaglerxserver/releases)

**Note:** If you would like to support versions of Eaglercraft 1.5 older than 22w34a (before singleplayer), add `-Deaglerxrewind.oldChunkFormat=true` to the JVM arguments in the run script. This will perform worse for both clients and the server, but will be compatible with every version of 1.5 going back to 2020.
